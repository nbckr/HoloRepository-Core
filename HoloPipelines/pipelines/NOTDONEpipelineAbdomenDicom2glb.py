# ----this pl in a nutshell:
# dicom2nifti
# use the new http request comp to NN segment the nifti file
# nifti2numpy
# getMultipleNumpy
# numpy2obj
# obj2gltf
# GLB coloring time? ';) (pygltflib)

# TODO should i make a cleanup comp for all those temp obj and nifti?
# from pipelines.components import compDcm2nifti
# from pipelines.components import (
#     compCommonPath,
# )  # I dont think this is here in API branch
# import pathlib


# def main(inputDicomPath, outputGlbPath):
#     generatedNiftiFolderPath = compDcm2nifti.main(
#        str(pathlib.Path(inputDicomPath)),
#         str(compCommonPath.nifti.joinpath("PleaseLookAtThis")),
#    )


# segmentedNiftiPath = compJobStatus.main(
#    generatedNiftiFolderPath, "PleaseLookAtThis"
# )
# generatedNumpyList = compNifti2numpy.main(segmentedNiftiPath)  # check args here pls
# will need to update comp to take a list of numpy list as well as folder of numpy list?
# and yeah will need to think of how i should return it
# for each numpy list
# 		generate obj >> conv to glb >> color
# but would that kinda make pl a bit messy?
# should i just let comp handle it in a case that it gets a list of stuff?


# if __name__ == "__main__":
# main()  # add sys.argv[] here
